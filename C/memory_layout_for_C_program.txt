Explain the memory layout of a c program.
============================================

A typical memory representation of C program consists 
of following sections.

1. Text segment
2. Initialized data segment
3. Uninitialized data segment
4. Stack
5. Heap

Low address





1. Text Segment:
=================
A text segment , also known as a code segment or simply as 
text, is one of the sections of a program in an object file
or in memory, which contains executable instructions.

As a memory region, a text segment may be placed below the
heap or stack in order to prevent heaps and stack overflows
from overwriting it.

Usually, the text segment is sharable so that only a single
copy needs to be in memory for frequently executed programs,
such as text editors, the C compiler, the shells, and so on.
Also, the text segment is often read-only, to prevent a 
program from accidentally modifying its instructions.

2. Initialized Data Segment:
============================
Initialized data segment, usually called simply the Data 
Segment. A data segment is a portion of virtual address 
space of a program, which contains the global variables 
and static variables that are initialized by the programmer.

Note that, data segment is not read-only, since the 
values of the variables can be altered at run time.

This segment can be further classified into initialized 
read-only area and initialized read-write area.

For instance the global string defined by 
char s[] = “hello world” in C and a C statement like 
int debug=1 outside the main (i.e. global) would be 
stored in initialized read-write area. And a global 
C statement like const char* string = “hello world” 
makes the string literal “hello world” to be stored 
in initialized read-only area and the character 
pointer variable string in initialized read-write area.

Ex: static int i = 10 will be stored in data segment 
and global int i = 10 will also be stored in data segment

3. Uninitialized Data Segment:
================================
Uninitialized data segment, often called the “bss” segment,
named after an ancient assembler operator that stood for 
“block started by symbol.” Data in this segment is 
initialized by the kernel to arithmetic 0 before the 
program starts executing

uninitialized data starts at the end of the data segment 
and contains all global variables and static variables 
that are initialized to zero or do not have explicit 
initialization in source code.

For instance a variable declared static int i; 
would be contained in the BSS segment.
For instance a global variable declared int j; 
would be contained in the BSS segment.

4. Stack:
===========
The stack area traditionally adjoined the heap area and 
grew the opposite direction; when the stack pointer met 
the heap pointer, free memory was exhausted. 
(With modern large address spaces and virtual memory 
techniques they may be placed almost anywhere, but they 
still typically grow opposite directions.)

The stack area contains the program stack, a 
LIFO structure, typically located in the higher parts 
of memory. On the standard PC x86 computer architecture 
it grows toward address zero; on some other architectures 
it grows the opposite direction. A “stack pointer” 
register tracks the top of the stack; it is adjusted each 
time a value is “pushed” onto the stack. The set of values 
pushed for one function call is termed a “stack frame”; 
A stack frame consists at minimum of a return address.

Stack, where automatic variables are stored, along with 
information that is saved each time a function is called. 
Each time a function is called, the address of where to 
return to and certain information about the caller’s 
environment, such as some of the machine registers, 
are saved on the stack. The newly called function then 
allocates room on the stack for its automatic and temporary 
variables. This is how recursive functions in C can work. 
Each time a recursive function calls itself, a new stack 
frame is used, so one set of variables doesn’t 
interfere with the variables from another instance of 
the function.

5. Heap:
==========
Heap is the segment where dynamic memory allocation 
usually takes place.

The heap area begins at the end of the BSS segment and 
grows to larger addresses from there.The Heap area is 
managed by malloc, realloc, and free, which may use 
the brk and sbrk system calls to adjust its size (note 
that the use of brk/sbrk and a single “heap area” is not 
required to fulfill the contract of malloc/realloc/free; 
they may also be implemented using mmap to reserve 
potentially non-contiguous regions of virtual memory 
into the process’ virtual address space). The Heap area 
is shared by all shared libraries and dynamically 
loaded modules in a process.

Examples.
============

The size(1) command reports the sizes (in bytes) of 
the text, data, and bss segments. ( for more 
details please refer man page of size(1) )

1. Check the following simple C program
#include <stdio.h>
 
int main(void)
{
    return 0;
}

[narendra@CentOS]$ gcc memory-layout.c -o memory-layout
[narendra@CentOS]$ size memory-layout
text       data        bss        dec        hex    filename
960        248          8       1216        4c0    memory-layout

2. Let us add one global variable in program, 
now check the size of bss.
#include <stdio.h>
 
int global; /* Uninitialized variable stored in bss*/
 
int main(void)
{
    return 0;
}

[narendra@CentOS]$ gcc memory-layout.c -o memory-layout
[narendra@CentOS]$ size memory-layout
text       data        bss        dec        hex    filename
 960        248         12       1220        4c4    memory-layout

3. Let us add one static variable which is also stored in bss.
#include <stdio.h>
 
int global; /* Uninitialized variable stored in bss*/
 
int main(void)
{
    static int i; /* Uninitialized static variable stored in bss */
    return 0;
}

[narendra@CentOS]$ gcc memory-layout.c -o memory-layout
[narendra@CentOS]$ size memory-layout
text       data        bss        dec        hex    filename
 960        248         16       1224        4c8    memory-layout

4. Let us initialize the static variable which will then 
be stored in Data Segment (DS)
#include <stdio.h>
 
int global; /* Uninitialized variable stored in bss*/
 
int main(void)
{
    static int i = 100; /* Initialized static variable stored in DS*/
    return 0;
}

[narendra@CentOS]$ gcc memory-layout.c -o memory-layout
[narendra@CentOS]$ size memory-layout
text       data        bss        dec        hex    filename
960         252         12       1224        4c8    memory-layout

5. Let us initialize the global variable which will 
then be stored in Data Segment (DS)
#include <stdio.h>
 
int global = 10; /* initialized global variable stored in DS*/
 
int main(void)
{
    static int i = 100; /* Initialized static variable stored in DS*/
    return 0;
}

[narendra@CentOS]$ gcc memory-layout.c -o memory-layout
[narendra@CentOS]$ size memory-layout
text       data        bss        dec        hex    filename
960         256          8       1224        4c8    memory-layout
