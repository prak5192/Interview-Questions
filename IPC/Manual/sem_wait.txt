       sem_timedwait():          _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L           ||
       _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 600

DESCRIPTION
       sem_wait()  decrements  (locks)  the semaphore pointed to by sem.
       If the semaphore's value is greater than zero, then the decrement
       proceeds,  and  the  function returns, immediately.  If the sema‐
       phore currently has the value zero, then the  call  blocks  until
       either  it  becomes  possible to perform the decrement (i.e., the
       semaphore value rises above zero), or a signal handler interrupts
       the call.

       sem_trywait()  is  the  same  as  sem_wait(),  except that if the
       decrement cannot be immediately performed, then call  returns  an
       error (errno set to EAGAIN) instead of blocking.

       sem_timedwait()  is the same as sem_wait(), except that abs_time‐
       out specifies a limit on the amount of time that the call  should
       block  if  the  decrement  cannot  be immediately performed.  The
       abs_timeout argument points to  a  structure  that  specifies  an
       absolute  timeout  in  seconds  and  nanoseconds since the Epoch,
       1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).  This structure  is  defined  as
       follows:

           struct timespec {
               time_t tv_sec;      /* Seconds */
               long   tv_nsec;     /* Nanoseconds [0 .. 999999999] */
           };

       If  the  timeout has already expired by the time of the call, and
       the semaphore could not be locked  immediately,  then  sem_timed‐
       wait() fails with a timeout error (errno set to ETIMEDOUT).

       If  the  operation  can be performed immediately, then sem_timed‐
       wait() never fails with a timeout error, regardless of the  value
       of  abs_timeout.  Furthermore, the validity of abs_timeout is not
       checked in this case.

RETURN VALUE
       All of these functions return 0 on success; on error,  the  value
       of  the semaphore is left unchanged, -1 is returned, and errno is
       set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINTR  The call was interrupted by a  signal  handler;  see  sig‐
              nal(7).

       EINVAL sem is not a valid semaphore.

       The following additional error can occur for sem_trywait():

       EAGAIN The  operation  could  not  be  performed without blocking
              (i.e., the semaphore currently has the value zero).

       The following additional errors can occur for sem_timedwait():

       EINVAL The value of  abs_timeout.tv_nsecs  is  less  than  0,  or
              greater than or equal to 1000 million.

       ETIMEDOUT
              The call timed out before the semaphore could be locked.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       A signal handler always interrupts a blocked call to one of these
       functions, regardless of the use of the  sigaction(2)  SA_RESTART
       flag.

EXAMPLE
       The (somewhat trivial) program shown below operates on an unnamed
       semaphore.  The program expects two command-line arguments.   The
       first  argument  specifies a seconds value that is used to set an
       alarm timer to generate a SIGALRM signal.  This handler  performs
       a  sem_post(3) to increment the semaphore that is being waited on
       in main() using sem_timedwait().  The second  command-line  argu‐
       ment  specifies  the  length  of  the  timeout,  in  seconds, for
       sem_timedwait().  The following shows what happens on two differ‐
       ent runs of the program:

           $ ./a.out 2 3
           About to call sem_timedwait()
           sem_post() from handler
           sem_getvalue() from handler; value = 1
           sem_timedwait() succeeded
           $ ./a.out 2 1
           About to call sem_timedwait()
           sem_timedwait() timed out
