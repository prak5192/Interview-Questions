SEM_OPEN(3)             Linux Programmer's Manual            SEM_OPEN(3)



NAME
       sem_open - initialize and open a named semaphore

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fcntl.h>           /* For O_* constants */
       #include <sys/stat.h>        /* For mode constants */
       #include <semaphore.h>

       sem_t *sem_open(const char *name, int oflag);
       sem_t *sem_open(const char *name, int oflag,
                       mode_t mode, unsigned int value);

       Link with -lrt or -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       sem_open()  creates  a  new  POSIX semaphore or opens an existing
       semaphore.  The semaphore is identified by name.  For details  of
       the construction of name, see sem_overview(7).

       The  oflag argument specifies flags that control the operation of
       the call.  (Definitions of the flags values can  be  obtained  by
       including <fcntl.h>.)  If O_CREAT is specified in oflag, then the
       semaphore is created if it does not  already  exist.   The  owner
       (user ID) of the semaphore is set to the effective user ID of the
       calling process.  The group ownership (group ID) is  set  to  the
       effective  group  ID of the calling process.  If both O_CREAT and
       O_EXCL are specified in oflag, then an error  is  returned  if  a
       semaphore with the given name already exists.

       If  O_CREAT  is specified in oflag, then two additional arguments
       must be supplied.  The mode argument specifies the permissions to
       be  placed on the new semaphore, as for open(2).  (Symbolic defi‐
       nitions for the permissions bits can  be  obtained  by  including
       <sys/stat.h>.)   The  permissions settings are masked against the
       process umask.  Both read and write permission should be  granted
       to  each class of user that will access the semaphore.  The value
       argument specifies the initial value for the new  semaphore.   If
       O_CREAT is specified, and a semaphore with the given name already
       exists, then mode and value are ignored.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, sem_open() returns the address of the new  semaphore;
       this  address  is used when calling other semaphore-related func‐
       tions.  On error, sem_open() returns SEM_FAILED, with  errno  set
       to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EACCES The semaphore exists, but the caller does not have permis‐
              sion to open it.

       EEXIST Both O_CREAT and O_EXCL were specified  in  oflag,  but  a
              semaphore with this name already exists.

       EINVAL value was greater than SEM_VALUE_MAX.

       EINVAL name  consists  of  just "/", followed by no other charac‐
              ters.

       EMFILE The process already has the maximum number  of  files  and
              open.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              name was too long.

       ENFILE The  system  limit  on  the total number of open files has
              been reached.

       ENOENT The O_CREAT flag was not specified in oflag and  no  sema‐
              phore  with  this  name exists; or, O_CREAT was specified,
              but name wasn't well formed.

       ENOMEM Insufficient memory.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.
