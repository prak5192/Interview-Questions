MSGCTL(2)               Linux Programmer's Manual              MSGCTL(2)



NAME
       msgctl - message control operations

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <sys/ipc.h>
       #include <sys/msg.h>

       int msgctl(int msqid, int cmd, struct msqid_ds *buf);

DESCRIPTION
       msgctl()  performs  the control operation specified by cmd on the
       message queue with identifier msqid.

       The msqid_ds data structure is defined in <sys/msg.h> as follows:

           struct msqid_ds {
               struct ipc_perm msg_perm;     /* Ownership and permissions */
               time_t          msg_stime;    /* Time of last msgsnd(2) */
               time_t          msg_rtime;    /* Time of last msgrcv(2) */
               time_t          msg_ctime;    /* Time of last change */
               unsigned long   __msg_cbytes; /* Current number of bytes in
                                                queue (nonstandard) */
               msgqnum_t       msg_qnum;     /* Current number of messages
                                                in queue */
               msglen_t        msg_qbytes;   /* Maximum number of bytes
                                                allowed in queue */
               pid_t           msg_lspid;    /* PID of last msgsnd(2) */
               pid_t           msg_lrpid;    /* PID of last msgrcv(2) */
           };

       The ipc_perm structure is defined in <sys/ipc.h> as follows  (the
       highlighted fields are settable using IPC_SET):

           struct ipc_perm {
               key_t          __key;       /* Key supplied to msgget(2) */
               uid_t          uid;         /* Effective UID of owner */
               gid_t          gid;         /* Effective GID of owner */
               uid_t          cuid;        /* Effective UID of creator */
               gid_t          cgid;        /* Effective GID of creator */
               unsigned short mode;        /* Permissions */
               unsigned short __seq;       /* Sequence number */
           };

       Valid values for cmd are:

       IPC_STAT
              Copy information from the kernel data structure associated
              with msqid into the msqid_ds structure pointed to by  buf.
              The caller must have read permission on the message queue.

       IPC_SET
              Write the values of some members of the msqid_ds structure
              pointed to by buf to the kernel data structure  associated
              with  this message queue, updating also its msg_ctime mem‐
              ber.  The following members of the structure are  updated:
              msg_qbytes,  msg_perm.uid,  msg_perm.gid,  and  (the least
              significant 9 bits of) msg_perm.mode.  The  effective  UID
              of the calling process must match the owner (msg_perm.uid)
              or creator (msg_perm.cuid) of the message  queue,  or  the
              caller  must be privileged.  Appropriate privilege (Linux:
              the CAP_IPC_RESOURCE capability) is required to raise  the
              msg_qbytes value beyond the system parameter MSGMNB.

       IPC_RMID
              Immediately  remove the message queue, awakening all wait‐
              ing reader and writer processes (with an error return  and
              errno set to EIDRM).  The calling process must have appro‐
              priate privileges or its effective user ID must be  either
              that of the creator or owner of the message queue.

       IPC_INFO (Linux-specific)
              Returns information about system-wide message queue limits
              and parameters in the structure pointed to by  buf.   This
              structure  is  of type msginfo (thus, a cast is required),
              defined in <sys/msg.h> if  the  _GNU_SOURCE  feature  test
              macro is defined:

                  struct msginfo {
                      int msgpool; /* Size in kibibytes of buffer pool
                                      used to hold message data;
                                      unused within kernel */
                      int msgmap;  /* Maximum number of entries in message
                                      map; unused within kernel */
                      int msgmax;  /* Maximum number of bytes that can be
                                      written in a single message */
                      int msgmnb;  /* Maximum number of bytes that can be
                                      written to queue; used to initialize
                                      msg_qbytes during queue creation
                                      (msgget(2)) */
                      int msgmni;  /* Maximum number of message queues */
                      int msgssz;  /* Message segment size;
                                      unused within kernel */
                      int msgtql;  /* Maximum number of messages on all queues
                                      in system; unused within kernel */
                      unsigned short int msgseg;
                                   /* Maximum number of segments;
                                      unused within kernel */
                  };

              The msgmni, msgmax, and msgmnb settings can be changed via
              /proc files of the same name; see proc(5) for details.

       MSG_INFO (Linux-specific)
              Returns a msginfo structure containing the  same  informa‐
              tion as for IPC_INFO, except that the following fields are
              returned with information about system resources  consumed
              by message queues: the msgpool field returns the number of
              message queues that currently exist  on  the  system;  the
              msgmap  field  returns the total number of messages in all
              queues on the system; and the  msgtql  field  returns  the
              total number of bytes in all messages in all queues on the
              system.

       MSG_STAT (Linux-specific)
              Returns a msqid_ds structure as  for  IPC_STAT.   However,
              the  msqid argument is not a queue identifier, but instead
              an index into the kernel's internal array  that  maintains
              information about all message queues on the system.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, IPC_STAT, IPC_SET, and IPC_RMID return 0.  A success‐
       ful IPC_INFO or MSG_INFO operation returns the index of the high‐
       est  used entry in the kernel's internal array recording informa‐
       tion about all message queues.  (This  information  can  be  used
       with repeated MSG_STAT operations to obtain information about all
       queues on the system.)  A successful MSG_STAT  operation  returns
       the identifier of the queue whose index was given in msqid.

       On error, -1 is returned with errno indicating the error.

ERRORS
       On failure, errno is set to one of the following:

       EACCES The argument cmd is equal to IPC_STAT or MSG_STAT, but the
              calling process does not have read permission on the  mes‐
              sage  queue  msqid,  and  does  not have the CAP_IPC_OWNER
              capability.

       EFAULT The argument cmd has the value IPC_SET  or  IPC_STAT,  but
              the address pointed to by buf isn't accessible.

       EIDRM  The message queue was removed.

       EINVAL Invalid value for cmd or msqid.  Or: for a MSG_STAT opera‐
              tion, the index value specified in msqid  referred  to  an
              array slot that is currently unused.

       EPERM  The  argument  cmd  has the value IPC_SET or IPC_RMID, but
              the effective user ID of the calling process  is  not  the
              creator (as found in msg_perm.cuid) or the owner (as found
              in msg_perm.uid) of the message queue, and the process  is
              not  privileged (Linux: it does not have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN
              capability).

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The IPC_INFO, MSG_STAT and MSG_INFO operations are  used  by  the
       ipcs(1)  program  to  provide information on allocated resources.
       In the future these may modified or moved to a /proc file  system
       interface.

       Various  fields  in the struct msqid_ds were typed as short under
       Linux 2.2 and have become long under Linux 2.4.  To  take  advan‐
       tage  of this, a recompilation under glibc-2.1.91 or later should
       suffice.  (The kernel distinguishes  old  and  new  calls  by  an
       IPC_64 flag in cmd.)
