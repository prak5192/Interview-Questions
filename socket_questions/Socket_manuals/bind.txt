BIND(2)                   Linux Programmer's Manual                   BIND(2)



NAME
       bind - bind a name to a socket

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>          /* See NOTES */
       #include <sys/socket.h>

       int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr,
                socklen_t addrlen);

DESCRIPTION
       When  a  socket  is  created with socket(2), it exists in a name space
       (address family) but has no address assigned to  it.   bind()  assigns
       the address specified to by addr to the socket referred to by the file
       descriptor sockfd.  addrlen specifies  the  size,  in  bytes,  of  the
       address  structure  pointed to by addr.  Traditionally, this operation
       is called “assigning a name to a socket”.

       It is normally necessary to assign a local address using bind() before
       a SOCK_STREAM socket may receive connections (see accept(2)).

       The rules used in name binding vary between address families.  Consult
       the manual entries in Section 7 for detailed information.  For AF_INET
       see  ip(7),  for  AF_INET6  see  ipv6(7), for AF_UNIX see unix(7), for
       AF_APPLETALK see ddp(7), for AF_PACKET see packet(7), for  AF_X25  see
       x25(7) and for AF_NETLINK see netlink(7).

       The  actual  structure passed for the addr argument will depend on the
       address family.  The sockaddr structure is defined as something like:

           struct sockaddr {
               sa_family_t sa_family;
               char        sa_data[14];
           }

       The only purpose of this structure is to cast  the  structure  pointer
       passed  in  addr  in  order  to  avoid compiler warnings.  See EXAMPLE
       below.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno  is
       set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EACCES The address is protected, and the user is not the superuser.

       EADDRINUSE
              The given address is already in use.

       EBADF  sockfd is not a valid descriptor.

       EINVAL The socket is already bound to an address.

       ENOTSOCK
              sockfd is a descriptor for a file, not a socket.

       The following errors are specific to UNIX domain (AF_UNIX) sockets:

       EACCES Search  permission is denied on a component of the path prefix.
              (See also path_resolution(7).)

       EADDRNOTAVAIL
              A nonexistent interface was requested or the requested  address
              was not local.

       EFAULT addr points outside the user's accessible address space.

       EINVAL The addrlen is wrong, or the socket was not in the AF_UNIX fam‐
              ily.

       ELOOP  Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving addr.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              addr is too long.

       ENOENT The file does not exist.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       ENOTDIR
              A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

       EROFS  The socket inode would reside on a read-only file system.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, 4.4BSD, POSIX.1-2001 (bind() first appeared in 4.2BSD).

NOTES
       POSIX.1-2001 does not require the inclusion of <sys/types.h>, and this
       header  file is not required on Linux.  However, some historical (BSD)
       implementations required this header file, and  portable  applications
       are probably wise to include it.

       The  third  argument  of bind() is in reality an int (and this is what
       4.x BSD and libc4 and libc5 have).  Some POSIX confusion  resulted  in
       the present socklen_t, also used by glibc.  See also accept(2).

BUGS
       The transparent proxy options are not described.

EXAMPLE
       An  example  of  the use of bind() with Internet domain sockets can be
       found in getaddrinfo(3).

       The following example shows how to bind a stream socket  in  the  UNIX
       (AF_UNIX) domain, and accept connections:

       #include <sys/socket.h>
       #include <sys/un.h>
       #include <stdlib.h>
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <string.h>

       #define MY_SOCK_PATH "/somepath"
       #define LISTEN_BACKLOG 50

       #define handle_error(msg) \
           do { perror(msg); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); } while (0)

       int
       main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
           int sfd, cfd;
           struct sockaddr_un my_addr, peer_addr;
           socklen_t peer_addr_size;

           sfd = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
           if (sfd == -1)
               handle_error("socket");

           memset(&my_addr, 0, sizeof(struct sockaddr_un));
                               /* Clear structure */
           my_addr.sun_family = AF_UNIX;
           strncpy(my_addr.sun_path, MY_SOCK_PATH,
                   sizeof(my_addr.sun_path) - 1);

           if (bind(sfd, (struct sockaddr *) &my_addr,
                   sizeof(struct sockaddr_un)) == -1)
               handle_error("bind");

           if (listen(sfd, LISTEN_BACKLOG) == -1)
               handle_error("listen");

           /* Now we can accept incoming connections one
              at a time using accept(2) */

           peer_addr_size = sizeof(struct sockaddr_un);
           cfd = accept(sfd, (struct sockaddr *) &peer_addr,
                        &peer_addr_size);
           if (cfd == -1)
               handle_error("accept");

           /* Code to deal with incoming connection(s)... */

           /* When no longer required, the socket pathname, MY_SOCK_PATH
              should be deleted using unlink(2) or remove(3) */
       }
