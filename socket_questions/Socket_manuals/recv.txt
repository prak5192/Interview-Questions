RECV(2)                   Linux Programmer's Manual                   RECV(2)



NAME
       recv, recvfrom, recvmsg - receive a message from a socket

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <sys/socket.h>

       ssize_t recv(int sockfd, void *buf, size_t len, int flags);

       ssize_t recvfrom(int sockfd, void *buf, size_t len, int flags,
                        struct sockaddr *src_addr, socklen_t *addrlen);

       ssize_t recvmsg(int sockfd, struct msghdr *msg, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       The recvfrom() and recvmsg() calls are used to receive messages from a
       socket, and may be used to receive data on a socket whether or not  it
       is connection-oriented.

       If  src_addr  is  not  NULL,  and the underlying protocol provides the
       source address, this source address is filled in.   When  src_addr  is
       NULL,  nothing  is  filled  in; in this case, addrlen is not used, and
       should also be NULL.  The argument addrlen is a value-result argument,
       which  the caller should initialize before the call to the size of the
       buffer associated with src_addr, and modified on  return  to  indicate
       the  actual size of the source address.  The returned address is trun‐
       cated if the buffer provided is too small; in this case, addrlen  will
       return a value greater than was supplied to the call.

       The  recv() call is normally used only on a connected socket (see con‐
       nect(2)) and is identical to recvfrom() with a NULL src_addr argument.

       All three routines return the length of the message on successful com‐
       pletion.   If  a  message  is  too long to fit in the supplied buffer,
       excess bytes may be discarded depending on the type of socket the mes‐
       sage is received from.

       If no messages are available at the socket, the receive calls wait for
       a message to arrive, unless the socket is nonblocking (see  fcntl(2)),
       in which case the value -1 is returned and the external variable errno
       is set to EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK.  The receive  calls  normally  return
       any  data  available,  up to the requested amount, rather than waiting
       for receipt of the full amount requested.

       The select(2) or poll(2) call may be used to determine when more  data
       arrives.

       The  flags argument to a recv() call is formed by ORing one or more of
       the following values:

       MSG_CMSG_CLOEXEC (recvmsg() only; since Linux 2.6.23)
              Set the close-on-exec flag for the file descriptor received via
              a  UNIX  domain  file descriptor using the SCM_RIGHTS operation
              (described in unix(7)).  This flag is useful for the same  rea‐
              sons as the O_CLOEXEC flag of open(2).

       MSG_DONTWAIT (since Linux 2.2)
              Enables  nonblocking  operation;  if the operation would block,
              the call fails with the error EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK  (this  can
              also  be  enabled  using  the  O_NONBLOCK flag with the F_SETFL
              fcntl(2)).

       MSG_ERRQUEUE (since Linux 2.2)
              This flag specifies that queued errors should be received  from
              the  socket  error  queue.  The error is passed in an ancillary
              message with  a  type  dependent  on  the  protocol  (for  IPv4
              IP_RECVERR).   The  user  should  supply a buffer of sufficient
              size.  See cmsg(3) and ip(7) for more information.  The payload
              of  the original packet that caused the error is passed as nor‐
              mal data via msg_iovec.  The original  destination  address  of
              the datagram that caused the error is supplied via msg_name.

              For  local  errors,  no  address is passed (this can be checked
              with the cmsg_len member of the cmsghdr).  For error  receives,
              the MSG_ERRQUEUE is set in the msghdr.  After an error has been
              passed, the pending socket error is regenerated  based  on  the
              next  queued error and will be passed on the next socket opera‐
              tion.

              The error is supplied in a sock_extended_err structure:

                  #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_NONE    0
                  #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_LOCAL   1
                  #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_ICMP    2
                  #define SO_EE_ORIGIN_ICMP6   3

                  struct sock_extended_err
                  {
                      uint32_t ee_errno;   /* error number */
                      uint8_t  ee_origin;  /* where the error originated */
                      uint8_t  ee_type;    /* type */
                      uint8_t  ee_code;    /* code */
                      uint8_t  ee_pad;     /* padding */
                      uint32_t ee_info;    /* additional information */
                      uint32_t ee_data;    /* other data */
                      /* More data may follow */
                  };

                  struct sockaddr *SO_EE_OFFENDER(struct sock_extended_err *);

              ee_errno  contains  the  errno  number  of  the  queued  error.
              ee_origin  is  the  origin  code of where the error originated.
              The   other   fields   are   protocol-specific.    The    macro
              SOCK_EE_OFFENDER  returns  a pointer to the address of the net‐
              work object where the error originated from given a pointer  to
              the  ancillary  message.   If  this  address  is not known, the
              sa_family member of the sockaddr  contains  AF_UNSPEC  and  the
              other fields of the sockaddr are undefined.  The payload of the
              packet that caused the error is passed as normal data.

              For local errors, no address is passed  (this  can  be  checked
              with  the cmsg_len member of the cmsghdr).  For error receives,
              the MSG_ERRQUEUE is set in the msghdr.  After an error has been
              passed,  the  pending  socket error is regenerated based on the
              next queued error and will be passed on the next socket  opera‐
              tion.

       MSG_OOB
              This  flag  requests receipt of out-of-band data that would not
              be received in the normal data stream.   Some  protocols  place
              expedited  data  at the head of the normal data queue, and thus
              this flag cannot be used with such protocols.

       MSG_PEEK
              This flag causes the receive operation to return data from  the
              beginning  of the receive queue without removing that data from
              the queue.  Thus, a subsequent receive  call  will  return  the
              same data.

       MSG_TRUNC (since Linux 2.2)
              For   raw   (AF_PACKET),   Internet   datagram   (since   Linux
              2.4.27/2.6.8), and netlink (since Linux 2.6.22) sockets: return
              the  real  length  of  the packet or datagram, even when it was
              longer than the passed buffer.  Not implemented for UNIX domain
              (unix(7)) sockets.

              For use with Internet stream sockets, see tcp(7).

       MSG_WAITALL (since Linux 2.2)
              This  flag  requests  that  the  operation block until the full
              request is satisfied.  However, the call may still return  less
              data  than requested if a signal is caught, an error or discon‐
              nect occurs, or the next data to be received is of a  different
              type than that returned.

       The  recvmsg()  call uses a msghdr structure to minimize the number of
       directly supplied arguments.  This structure is defined as follows  in
       <sys/socket.h>:

           struct iovec {                    /* Scatter/gather array items */
               void  *iov_base;              /* Starting address */
               size_t iov_len;               /* Number of bytes to transfer */
           };

           struct msghdr {
               void         *msg_name;       /* optional address */
               socklen_t     msg_namelen;    /* size of address */
               struct iovec *msg_iov;        /* scatter/gather array */
               size_t        msg_iovlen;     /* # elements in msg_iov */
               void         *msg_control;    /* ancillary data, see below */
               size_t        msg_controllen; /* ancillary data buffer len */
               int           msg_flags;      /* flags on received message */
           };

       Here msg_name and msg_namelen specify the source address if the socket
       is unconnected; msg_name may be given as a NULL pointer  if  no  names
       are  desired  or required.  The fields msg_iov and msg_iovlen describe
       scatter-gather  locations,  as  discussed  in  readv(2).   The   field
       msg_control,  which  has length msg_controllen, points to a buffer for
       other protocol control-related  messages  or  miscellaneous  ancillary
       data.   When  recvmsg()  is  called, msg_controllen should contain the
       length of the available buffer in msg_control; upon return from a suc‐
       cessful  call  it  will  contain  the  length  of  the control message
       sequence.

       The messages are of the form:

           struct cmsghdr {
               socklen_t     cmsg_len;     /* data byte count, including hdr */
               int           cmsg_level;   /* originating protocol */
               int           cmsg_type;    /* protocol-specific type */
           /* followed by
               unsigned char cmsg_data[]; */
           };

       Ancillary data should only  be  accessed  by  the  macros  defined  in
       cmsg(3).

       As  an  example,  Linux  uses  this  ancillary  data mechanism to pass
       extended errors, IP options, or  file  descriptors  over  UNIX  domain
       sockets.

       The  msg_flags  field in the msghdr is set on return of recvmsg().  It
       can contain several flags:

       MSG_EOR
              indicates end-of-record; the data returned completed  a  record
              (generally used with sockets of type SOCK_SEQPACKET).

       MSG_TRUNC
              indicates that the trailing portion of a datagram was discarded
              because the datagram was larger than the buffer supplied.

       MSG_CTRUNC
              indicates that some control data were discarded due to lack  of
              space in the buffer for ancillary data.

       MSG_OOB
              is returned to indicate that expedited or out-of-band data were
              received.

       MSG_ERRQUEUE
              indicates that no data was received but an extended error  from
              the socket error queue.

RETURN VALUE
       These  calls  return  the  number of bytes received, or -1 if an error
       occurred.  The return value will be 0 when the peer has  performed  an
       orderly shutdown.

ERRORS
       These  are  some standard errors generated by the socket layer.  Addi‐
       tional errors may be generated and returned from the underlying proto‐
       col modules; see their manual pages.

       EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK
              The  socket  is  marked  nonblocking  and the receive operation
              would block, or a receive timeout had been set and the  timeout
              expired  before  data was received.  POSIX.1-2001 allows either
              error to be returned for this case, and does not require  these
              constants  to  have  the  same value, so a portable application
              should check for both possibilities.

       EBADF  The argument sockfd is an invalid descriptor.

       ECONNREFUSED
              A remote host refused to allow the  network  connection  (typi‐
              cally because it is not running the requested service).

       EFAULT The  receive  buffer  pointer(s)  point  outside  the process's
              address space.

       EINTR  The receive was interrupted by delivery of a signal before  any
              data were available; see signal(7).

       EINVAL Invalid argument passed.

       ENOMEM Could not allocate memory for recvmsg().

       ENOTCONN
              The  socket  is  associated with a connection-oriented protocol
              and has not been connected (see connect(2) and accept(2)).

       ENOTSOCK
              The argument sockfd does not refer to a socket.

CONFORMING TO
       4.4BSD (these function calls first appeared in 4.2BSD), POSIX.1-2001.

       POSIX.1-2001 only describes the  MSG_OOB,  MSG_PEEK,  and  MSG_WAITALL
       flags.

NOTES
       The  prototypes given above follow glibc2.  The Single UNIX Specifica‐
       tion agrees, except that it has return values of type  ssize_t  (while
       4.x  BSD and libc4 and libc5 all have int).  The flags argument is int
       in 4.x BSD, but unsigned int in libc4 and libc5.  The len argument  is
       int  in  4.x BSD, but size_t in libc4 and libc5.  The addrlen argument
       is int * in 4.x BSD, libc4 and libc5.  The  present   socklen_t *  was
       invented by POSIX.  See also accept(2).

       According  to  POSIX.1-2001,  the  msg_controllen  field of the msghdr
       structure should be typed as socklen_t, but glibc currently  types  it
       as size_t.

       See  recvmmsg(2)  for  information  about a Linux-specific system call
       that can be used to receive multiple datagrams in a single call.

EXAMPLE
       An example of the use of recvfrom() is shown in getaddrinfo(3).
