DESCRIPTION
       Given node and service, which identify an Internet host and a service,
       getaddrinfo()  returns  one or more addrinfo structures, each of which
       contains an Internet address that  can  be  specified  in  a  call  to
       bind(2)  or connect(2).  The getaddrinfo() function combines the func‐
       tionality provided by the getservbyname(3) and getservbyport(3)  func‐
       tions into a single interface, but unlike the latter functions, getad‐
       drinfo() is reentrant and allows programs  to  eliminate  IPv4-versus-
       IPv6 dependencies.

       The  addrinfo  structure  used by getaddrinfo() contains the following
       fields:

           struct addrinfo {
               int              ai_flags;
               int              ai_family;
               int              ai_socktype;
               int              ai_protocol;
               size_t           ai_addrlen;
               struct sockaddr *ai_addr;
               char            *ai_canonname;
               struct addrinfo *ai_next;
           };

       The hints argument points to an addrinfo structure that specifies cri‐
       teria for selecting the socket address structures returned in the list
       pointed to by res.  If hints is not NULL  it  points  to  an  addrinfo
       structure whose ai_family, ai_socktype, and ai_protocol specify crite‐
       ria that limit the set of socket addresses returned by  getaddrinfo(),
       as follows:

       ai_family   This  field  specifies  the desired address family for the
                   returned addresses.  Valid values for this  field  include
                   AF_INET  and AF_INET6.  The value AF_UNSPEC indicates that
                   getaddrinfo()  should  return  socket  addresses  for  any
                   address family (either IPv4 or IPv6, for example) that can
                   be used with node and service.

       ai_socktype This field specifies the preferred socket type, for  exam‐
                   ple SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM.  Specifying 0 in this field
                   indicates  that  socket  addresses  of  any  type  can  be
                   returned by getaddrinfo().

       ai_protocol This  field specifies the protocol for the returned socket
                   addresses.  Specifying 0  in  this  field  indicates  that
                   socket  addresses  with  any  protocol  can be returned by
                   getaddrinfo().

       ai_flags    This field specifies additional options, described  below.
                   Multiple  flags  are  specified  by  bitwise  OR-ing  them
                   together.

       All the other fields in the structure pointed to by hints must contain
       either  0 or a NULL pointer, as appropriate.  Specifying hints as NULL
       is equivalent to setting ai_socktype and ai_protocol to  0;  ai_family
       to AF_UNSPEC; and ai_flags to (AI_V4MAPPED | AI_ADDRCONFIG).

       node  specifies either a numerical network address (for IPv4, numbers-
       and-dots notation as supported by inet_aton(3); for IPv6,  hexadecimal
       string  format  as  supported by inet_pton(3)), or a network hostname,
       whose network addresses are looked up and resolved.  If hints.ai_flags
       contains the AI_NUMERICHOST flag then node must be a numerical network
       address.  The AI_NUMERICHOST flag suppresses any  potentially  lengthy
       network host address lookups.

       If  the  AI_PASSIVE  flag  is specified in hints.ai_flags, and node is
       NULL,  then  the  returned  socket  addresses  will  be  suitable  for
       bind(2)ing  a  socket  that  will accept(2) connections.  The returned
       socket address will contain the  "wildcard  address"  (INADDR_ANY  for
       IPv4  addresses,  IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT  for  IPv6  address).  The wildcard
       address is used by applications (typically  servers)  that  intend  to
       accept  connections  on any of the hosts's network addresses.  If node
       is not NULL, then the AI_PASSIVE flag is ignored.

       If the AI_PASSIVE flag is not set in hints.ai_flags, then the returned
       socket  addresses will be suitable for use with connect(2), sendto(2),
       or sendmsg(2).  If node is NULL, then the network address will be  set
       to the loopback interface address (INADDR_LOOPBACK for IPv4 addresses,
       IN6ADDR_LOOPBACK_INIT for IPv6 address); this is used by  applications
       that intend to communicate with peers running on the same host.

       service  sets  the  port  in each returned address structure.  If this
       argument is a service name (see services(5)), it is translated to  the
       corresponding  port  number.  This argument can also be specified as a
       decimal number, which is simply converted to binary.   If  service  is
       NULL,  then  the  port number of the returned socket addresses will be
       left uninitialized.  If AI_NUMERICSERV is specified in  hints.ai_flags
       and  service is not NULL, then service must point to a string contain‐
       ing a numeric port number.  This flag is used to inhibit  the  invoca‐
       tion of a name resolution service in cases where it is known not to be
       required.

       Either node or service, but not both, may be NULL.

       The getaddrinfo() function allocates and initializes a linked list  of
       addrinfo  structures,  one  for each network address that matches node
       and service, subject to any restrictions imposed by hints, and returns
       a  pointer  to  the start of the list in res.  The items in the linked
       list are linked by the ai_next field.

       There are several reasons why the linked list may have more  than  one
       addrinfo  structure, including: the network host is multihomed, acces‐
       sible over multiple protocols (e.g. both AF_INET and AF_INET6); or the
       same  service is available from multiple socket types (one SOCK_STREAM
       address and another SOCK_DGRAM address, for example).   Normally,  the
       application  should try using the addresses in the order in which they
       are returned.  The  sorting  function  used  within  getaddrinfo()  is
       defined  in RFC 3484; the order can be tweaked for a particular system
       by editing /etc/gai.conf (available since glibc 2.5).

       If hints.ai_flags includes the AI_CANONNAME flag, then  the  ai_canon‐
       name  field  of  the  first of the addrinfo structures in the returned
       list is set to point to the official name of the host.

       The remaining fields of each returned addrinfo structure are  initial‐
       ized as follows:

       * The ai_family, ai_socktype, and ai_protocol fields return the socket
         creation parameters (i.e., these fields have the same meaning as the
         corresponding arguments of socket(2)).  For example, ai_family might
         return AF_INET or AF_INET6; ai_socktype might return  SOCK_DGRAM  or
         SOCK_STREAM; and ai_protocol returns the protocol for the socket.

       * A  pointer to the socket address is placed in the ai_addr field, and
         the length of the  socket  address,  in  bytes,  is  placed  in  the
         ai_addrlen field.

       If hints.ai_flags includes the AI_ADDRCONFIG flag, then IPv4 addresses
       are returned in the list pointed to by res only if  the  local  system
       has  at least one IPv4 address configured, and IPv6 addresses are only
       returned if the local system has at least one IPv6 address configured.

       If hint.ai_flags specifies the AI_V4MAPPED flag,  and  hints.ai_family
       was  specified  as  AF_INET6,  and no matching IPv6 addresses could be
       found, then return IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses in the list  pointed  to
       by   res.    If   both   AI_V4MAPPED   and  AI_ALL  are  specified  in
       hints.ai_flags, then return both IPv6 and IPv4-mapped  IPv6  addresses
       in  the  list  pointed to by res.  AI_ALL is ignored if AI_V4MAPPED is
       not also specified.

       The freeaddrinfo() function frees the memory that  was  allocated  for
       the dynamically allocated linked list res.

   Extensions to getaddrinfo() for Internationalized Domain Names
       Starting  with  glibc 2.3.4, getaddrinfo() has been extended to selec‐
       tively allow the incoming and outgoing hostnames to  be  transparently
       converted  to  and from the Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) format
       (see  RFC  3490,  Internationalizing  Domain  Names  in   Applications
       (IDNA)).  Four new flags are defined:

       AI_IDN If  this flag is specified, then the node name given in node is
              converted to IDN format if necessary.  The source  encoding  is
              that of the current locale.

              If  the  input name contains non-ASCII characters, then the IDN
              encoding is used.  Those parts of the node name  (delimited  by
              dots) that contain non-ASCII characters are encoded using ASCII
              Compatible Encoding (ACE) before being passed to the name reso‐
              lution functions.

       AI_CANONIDN
              After  a  successful  name lookup, and if the AI_CANONNAME flag
              was specified, getaddrinfo() will return the canonical name  of
              the  node  corresponding to the addrinfo structure value passed
              back.  The return value is an exact copy of the value  returned
              by the name resolution function.

              If the name is encoded using ACE, then it will contain the xn--
              prefix for one or more components  of  the  name.   To  convert
              these  components into a readable form the AI_CANONIDN flag can
              be passed in addition to AI_CANONNAME.  The resulting string is
              encoded using the current locale's encoding.

       AI_IDN_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED, AI_IDN_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES
              Setting  these  flags  will  enable  the  IDNA_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED
              (allow     unassigned     Unicode     code     points)      and
              IDNA_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES  (check  output  to make sure it is a
              STD3 conforming hostname) flags respectively to be used in  the
              IDNA handling.

RETURN VALUE
       getaddrinfo()  returns  0  if  it  succeeds,  or  one of the following
       nonzero error codes:

       EAI_ADDRFAMILY
              The specified network host does not have any network  addresses
              in the requested address family.

       EAI_AGAIN
              The  name  server returned a temporary failure indication.  Try
              again later.

       EAI_BADFLAGS
              hints.ai_flags  contains  invalid  flags;  or,   hints.ai_flags
              included AI_CANONNAME and name was NULL.

       EAI_FAIL
              The name server returned a permanent failure indication.

       EAI_FAMILY
              The requested address family is not supported.

       EAI_MEMORY
              Out of memory.

       EAI_NODATA
              The  specified  network host exists, but does not have any net‐
              work addresses defined.

       EAI_NONAME
              The node or service is not known; or both node and service  are
              NULL;  or  AI_NUMERICSERV  was  specified in hints.ai_flags and
              service was not a numeric port-number string.

       EAI_SERVICE
              The requested service is not available for the requested socket
              type.   It  may  be available through another socket type.  For
              example, this error could occur if service was "shell" (a  ser‐
              vice   only   available   on   stream   sockets),   and  either
              hints.ai_protocol was  IPPROTO_UDP,  or  hints.ai_socktype  was
              SOCK_DGRAM;  or  the error could occur if service was not NULL,
              and hints.ai_socktype was SOCK_RAW (a socket type that does not
              support the concept of services).

       EAI_SOCKTYPE
              The  requested socket type is not supported.  This could occur,
              for example, if  hints.ai_socktype  and  hints.ai_protocol  are
              inconsistent (e.g., SOCK_DGRAM and IPPROTO_TCP, respectively).

       EAI_SYSTEM
              Other system error, check errno for details.

       The  gai_strerror()  function  translates these error codes to a human
       readable string, suitable for error reporting.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.  The getaddrinfo() function is documented in RFC 2553.

NOTES
       getaddrinfo() supports the address%scope-id  notation  for  specifying
       the IPv6 scope-ID.

       AI_ADDRCONFIG,  AI_ALL,  and  AI_V4MAPPED  are  available  since glibc
       2.3.3.  AI_NUMERICSERV is available since glibc 2.3.4.

       According to POSIX.1-2001,  specifying  hints  as  NULL  should  cause
       ai_flags  to  be  assumed  as  0.  The GNU C library instead assumes a
       value of (AI_V4MAPPED | AI_ADDRCONFIG) for this case, since this value
       is considered an improvement on the specification.

EXAMPLE
       The  following programs demonstrate the use of getaddrinfo(), gai_str‐
       error(), freeaddrinfo(), and getnameinfo(3).  The programs are an echo
       server and client for UDP datagrams.
